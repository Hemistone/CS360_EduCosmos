 *  the root node should be changed. But we don't change the root node to
 *  the new page. The old root page is used as the new root node; thus the
 *  root page is fixed always.

 * Function: Four edubtm_root_insert(ObjectID*, PageID*, InternalItem*)
 *
 * Description:
 * (Following description is for original ODYSSEUS/COSMOS BtM.
 *  For ODYSSEUS/EduCOSMOS EduBtM, refer to the EduBtM project manual.)
 *
 *  This routine is called when a new entry was inserted into the root page and
 *  it was splitted two pages, 'root' and 'item->pid'. The new root should be
 *  made by the given root Page IDentifier and the sibling entry 'item'.
 *  We make it a rule to fix the root page; so a new page is allocated and
 *  the root node is copied into the newly allocated page. The root node
 *  is changed so that it points to the newly allocated node and the 'item->pid'.
 *
 * Returns:
 *  Error code
 *    some errors caused by function calls
