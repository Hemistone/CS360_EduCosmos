 * Module: edubtm_Delete.c
 *
 * Description : 
 *  This function edubtm_Delete(...) recursively calls itself until the type
 *  of root page becomes LEAF.  If the root page is an internal page, it
 *  may get the proper child page using the binary search routine and then
 *  recursively calls itself using the child as a root page. If the filled
 *  area of the child page is less than half of the page, it should merge
 *  or redistribute using the given root, and set the flag 'f' according to
 *  the result status of the given root page.
 *
 *  If the root page is a leaf page , it find out the correct node (entry)
 *  using the binary search routine.  If the entry is normal,  it simply
 *  delete the ObjectID or the entry when the # of ObjectIDs becomes zero.
 *  The entry, however, is not normal, that is, if the overflow page is used,
 *  the special routine btm_DeleteOverflow(...) should be called. The # of
 *  ObjectIDs will be returned by the result of the btm_DeleteOverflow(...),
 *  if the total # of ObjectIDs is less than 1/4 of the page and the ObjectIDs
 *  in the overflow page should be moved to the leaf page. (This process may
 *  has a complicate problem which the leaf page may be splitted in spite of
 *  deleteing not inserting an ObjectID.)
 *
 *  Deleting an ObjectID may cause redistribute pages and by this reason, the
 *  page may be splitted.
 *
 * Exports:
 *  Four edubtm_Delete(ObjectID*, PageID*, KeyDesc*, KeyValue*, ObjectID*,
 *                  Boolean*, Boolean*, InternalItem*, Pool*, DeallocListElem*)
