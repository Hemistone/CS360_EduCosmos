 * Module: edubtm_BinarySearch.c

 * Description :
 *  This file has three function about searching. All these functions use the
 *  binary search algorithm. If the entry is found successfully, it returns 
 *  TRUE and the correct position as an index, otherwise, it returns FALSE and
 *  the index whose key value is the largest in the given page but less than
 *  the given key value in the function edubtm_BinarSearchInternal; in the
 *  function edubtm_BinarySearchLeaf() the index whose key value is the smallest
 *  in the given page but larger than the given key value.
 *
 * Exports:
 *  Boolean edubtm_BinarySearchInternal(BtreeInternal*, KeyDesc*, KeyValue*, Two*)
 *  Boolean edubtm_BinarySearchLeaf(BtreeLeaf*, KeyDesc*, KeyValue*, Two*)
